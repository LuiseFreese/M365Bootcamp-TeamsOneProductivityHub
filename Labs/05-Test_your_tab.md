## Test your tab

Build and run your application using the following commands:

```Bash
npm start
```

> **üìå NOTE üìå :** `npm install` will only be needed once for the entire lab regardless of how many times you start your app.

Make sure `ngrok` is running in the background for tunneling.

To test your application, you need to upload your application to Teams. Open the Microsoft Teams client, select the **...** button on the left-hand menu and go to **App Studio**. Click the **Manifest Editor** tab and select **Import an existing app**.
